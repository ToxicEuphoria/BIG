Bitcoin Investing Group

Built For John.  John is a young professional, has heard about things like roth IRAs, 401Ks, mutual funds, real estate and has even dabbled in the stock market where he got marginal returns around 7% but started seeing losses that made him scared.  He also was attracted to starting a business because of the higher margins, but after trying to start a business found that it was considerably harder to start a business than it was to invest in the stock market.... just had low returns.

He's heard about Bitcoin, and is skeptical.  He understands it's a little like "the wild west" and that there is opportunity, but still doesn't trust it.  He wants to test it out, but he is just feeling like.... uneasy.  If there were someone that's already done it and could guide him he would be SO down.  Maybe invest like $500 just to test, but then after testing is willling to put in $10,000.
